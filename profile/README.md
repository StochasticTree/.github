# StochasticTree

Software for building stochastic tree ensembles (i.e. BART, XBART) for supervised learning and causal inference.

# Getting Started

`StochasticTree` is composed of a C++ "core" and R / Python interfaces to that core. 
Source code is available in [the `stochtree` monorepo](https://github.com/StochasticTree/stochtree) 
and documentation sites are available for the [R package](https://stochastictree.github.io/stochtree-r/) 
and the [python package](https://stochastictree.github.io/stochtree-python/).
